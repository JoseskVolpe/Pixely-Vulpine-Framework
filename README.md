# PixelyVulpine-Layout
Powerful, modern and lightweight framework library for J2ME MIDlets

# Objectives<br>
## To be beautiful<br>
The framework shall follow modern's minimalist standards with some smooth animations<br>
## To be independent<br>
No use of third-party libraries, unless they are open-source and accepts the MIT license (Code shall be merged, .jar must not be used)<br>
I want it to be usable in J2ME SDK Mobile, so i can't use .jar libraries on this<br>
## To be universal<br>
It should be compatible with QWERTY, Candybar and Touchscreen devices. Compatible with atleast 90% of MIDP 2.0+ CLDC 1.1 phones, from lower to higher end devices<br>
The UIs shall also be automatically adjustable to the screen's resolution<br>
It shall be cool to use on Android devices with J2ME Loader aswell like it were a native Android app<br>
## To be touch optimized<br>
There's few J2ME apps that works great on touch, it should be well optimized for touch devices, but still, it needs to be 100% compatible with non-touchscreen devices<br>
## To be lightweight<br>
It should cost few RAM and storage resource, main maximum should be 40Kb, but no more than 100Kb<br>
## To be customizable<br>
The developer will be able to customize colors, textures, backgrounds and create it's own custom contents for this framework<br>
## To be easy<br>
It should be easy to use on IDEs. Just some layout.addContent(Content) and you made a cool advanced design<br>
## Open-source<br>
It shall be open-source and MIT license, so you can do your projects, including closed-source ones, without the need to reinventing the whell<br>
## To be fast<br>
There'll be loading ofcourse, but they should not disturb much and take much long<br>
## Multilanguage<br>
The developer should be able to make their MIDlet multilanguage with some XML file.<br>
## To be laggy... But not much<br>
Miracles can't be done, Â¿right? These phones were itself laggy. Target is from 10 to 24 FPS with some few cool effects. It may drop to 2 or 4 FPS, however, it is the developer's (and the phone's capabilities) responsability on this. But the framework needs to be sufficiently optimized to keep the framerate stable.<br>
To keep the FPS stable, heavy effects like transparency will exist, but limited and not standardized, and will be manually and automatically configurable.<br>
## Legacy compatible (maybe)
It might be compatible with legacy LCDUI APIs
